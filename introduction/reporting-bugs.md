title: Reporting Bugs and Other Issues
---

All issues pertaining to the Qubes OS Project (including auxiliary
infrastructure such as the [website](/)) are tracked in
[qubes-issues](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues), our GitHub
issue tracker. If you're looking for help, please see [Help, Support, Mailing
Lists, and Forum](/support/).

## Important

- **To disclose a security issue confidentially, please see the
  [Security](/security/) page.**

- **In all other cases, please do not email individual developers about
  issues.**

- **Please note that many issues can be resolved by reading the
  [documentation](/doc/).**

- **If you see something that should be changed in the documentation, [submit a
  change](/doc/doc-guidelines/).**

## Search Tips ##

[Search both open and closed
issues.](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue)
For example, you may be experiencing a bug that was just fixed, in which case
the report for that bug is probably closed. In this case, it would be useful to
view [all bug reports, both open and closed, with the most recently updated
sorted to the
top](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=label%3Abug+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

[Search using labels.](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/labels) For
example, you can search issues by priority
([blocker](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/labels/P%3A%20blocker),
[critical](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/labels/P%3A%20critical),
[major](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/labels/P%3A%20major), etc.) and
by component
([core](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22C%3A+core%22),
[manager/widget](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22C%3A+manager%2Fwidget%22+),
[Xen](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22C%3A+Xen%22),
etc.).

Only Qubes team members can apply labels. Every issue must have exactly one
**type** (`T: bug`, `T: enhancement`, or `T: task`), exactly one **priority**
(e.g., `P: major`), and at least one **component** (e.g., `C: core`). Issues
may have additional labels, if applicable (e.g., `crypto`, `ux`).

## Issue tracker guidelines

### The issue tracker is not a discussion forum

The issue tracker is a tool to help the developers be more productive and
efficient in their work. It is not a place for discussion. If you wish to
discuss something in the issue tracker, please do so on the forum or mailing
lists (see [Help, Support, Mailing Lists, and Forum](/support/)). You can
simply link to the relevant issue in your discussion post.

This guideline is important for keeping issues focused on *actionable
information*, which helps the developers to stay focused on their work. When
developers come back to an issue to work on it, we do not want them to have to
sift through a large number of unnecessary comments before they can get
started. In many cases, an issue that gets "too big" essentially becomes more
trouble than it's worth, and no developer will touch it (also see [every issue
must be about a single, actionable
thing](#every-issue-must-be-about-a-single-actionable-thing)). In these cases,
we sometimes have to close the issue and open a new one. This is a waste of
energy for everyone involved, so we ask that everyone help to avoid repeating
this pattern.

### Do not submit questions

[qubes-issues](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues) is not the place
to ask questions. This includes, but is not limited to, troubleshooting
questions and questions about how to do things with Qubes. Instead, see [Help,
Support, Mailing Lists, and Forum](/support/) for appropriate place to ask
questions. By contrast,
[qubes-issues](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues) is meant for
tracking more general bugs, enhancements, and tasks that affect a broad range
of Qubes users.

### Use the issue template

When you open a new issue, an issue template is provided for you. Please use
it. Do not delete it. The issue template is carefully designed to elicit
important information. Without this information, the issue is likely to be
incomplete. (If certain sections are not applicable, you may remove them, but
please do so only sparingly and only if they are *truly* not applicable.)

It is also important to note the placement and content of the HTML comments in
the issue template. These help us to have issues with a consistent format.

### Every issue must be about a single, actionable thing

If your issue is not actionable, please see [Help, Support, Mailing Lists, and
Forum](/support/) for the appropriate place to post it. If your issue would be
about more than one thing, file them as separate issues instead. This means we
should generally not try to use a single issue as a "meta" or "epic" issue that
exists only to group, contain, or track other issues. Instead, when there is a
need to group multiple related issues together, use
[projects](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/projects).

This guideline is extremely important for making the issue tracker a useful
tool for the developers. When an issue is too big and composite, it becomes
intractable and drastically increases the likelihood that nothing will get
done. Such issues also tend to encourage an excessive amount of general
discussion that is simply not appropriate for a technical issue tracker (see
[the issue tracker is not a discussion
forum](#the-issue-tracker-is-not-a-discussion-forum)).

### New issues should not be duplicates of existing issues

Before you submit an issue, check to see whether it has already been reported.
Search through the existing issues -- both open and closed -- by typing your
key words in the **Filters** box. If you find an issue that seems to be similar
to yours, read through it. If you find an issue that is the same as or subsumes
yours, leave a comment on the existing issue rather than filing a new one, even
if the existing issue is closed. If an issue affects more than one Qubes
version, we usually keep only one issue for all versions. The Qubes team will
see your comment and reopen the issue, if appropriate. For example, you can
leave a comment with additional information to help the maintainer debug it.
Adding a comment will subscribe you to email notifications, which can be
helpful in getting important updates regarding the issue. If you don't have
anything to add but still want to receive email updates, you can click the
"Subscribe" button at the side or bottom of the comments.

### Every issue must be of a single type

Every issue must be exactly one of the following types: a bug report (`bug`), a
feature or improvement request (`enhancement`), or a task (`task`). Do not file
multi-typed issues. Instead, file multiple issues of distinct types. The Qubes
team will classify your issue according to its type.

### New issues should include all relevant information

When you file a new issue, you should be sure to include the version of Qubes
you're using, as well as versions of related software packages ([how to copy
information out of dom0](/doc/how-to-copy-from-dom0/)). If your issue is
related to hardware, provide as many details as possible about the hardware. A
great way to do this is by [generating and submitting a Hardware Compatibility
List (HCL) report](/doc/hcl/#generating-and-submitting-new-reports), then
linking to it in your issue. You may also need to use command-line tools such
as `lspci`. If you're reporting a bug in a package that is in a
[testing](/doc/testing/) repository, please reference the appropriate issue in
the [updates-status](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues)
repository. Project maintainers really appreciate thorough explanations. It
usually helps them address the problem more quickly, so everyone wins!

### Use the provided issue template

Please use the provided issue template.
Do not delete it or remove parts of it.
The issue template is carefully designed to elicit important information.
Without this information, the issue is likely to be incomplete.

It is also important to note the placement and content of the HTML comments in the issue template.
These help us to have issues with a consistent format.

### There are no guarantees that your issue will be addressed

Keep in mind that `qubes-issues` is an issue tracker, not a support system.
Creating a new issue is simply a way for you to submit an item for the Qubes
team's consideration. It is up to the Qubes team to decide whether or how to
address your issue, which may include closing the issue without taking any
action on it. Even if your issue is kept open, however, you should not expect
it to be addressed within any particular time frame, or at all. At the time of
this writing, there are well over one thousand open issues in `qubes-issues`.
The Qubes team has its own roadmap and priorities, which will govern the manner
and order in which open issues are addressed.

## Following up afterward

If the Qubes developers make a code change that resolves your issue, then your
GitHub issue will typically be closed from the relevant patch message. After
that, the package containing the fix will move to the appropriate
[testing](/doc/testing/) repository, then to the appropriate stable repository.
If you so choose, you can test the fix while it's in the
[testing](/doc/testing/) repository, or you can wait for it to land in the
stable repository. If, after testing the fix, you find that it does not really
fix your bug, please leave a comment on your issue explaining the situation.
When you do, we will receive a notification and respond on your issue or reopen
it (or both). Please **do not** create a duplicate issue or attempt to contact
the developers individually about your problem.

In other cases, your issue may be closed with a specific resolution, such as
`R: invalid`, `R: duplicate`, or `R: won't fix`. Each of these labels has a
description that explains the label. We'll also leave a comment explaining why
we're closing the issue with one of these specific resolutions. If the issue is
closed without one of these specific resolutions, then it means, by default,
that your reported bug was fixed or your requested enhancement was implemented.
